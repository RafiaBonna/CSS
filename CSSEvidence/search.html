                By William Wordsworth
                I wandered lonely as a cloud <br>
                That floats on high o'er vales and hills, <br>
                When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
                A host, of golden daffodils; <br>
                Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br>
                Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. <br>
